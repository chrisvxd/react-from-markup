# The rehydrate function

```javascript
rehydrate(rootNode, rehydrators, options);
```

## Contract

When run, `rehydrate` will convert the contents of any [markup containers](/containers) into React elements.

## Parameters

* `rootNode`: a node on your page where `react-from-markup` should start looking for markup containers.

  A simple implementation would have the first child of your `<body />` element be a `<div id="root" />`, and put all your markup inside. Then, you can use `document.getElementById("root")` as your `rootNode`.
* `rehydrators`: a keyed object containing your rehydrator functions, each matching the [rehydrator interface](/api/rehydrator)

  A key of `SiteHeader` means that the provided rehydrator will be run for an element with `data-rehydratable="SiteHeader"` set.
* `options`: an object that configures `rehydrate()`
  * `extra`: an object that will be passed to each [rehydrator](/api/rehydrator). Can be used to provide some page state information to your components, such as user information or analytics hooks.

## Return value

Returns a `Promise` that resolves when `rootNode` has been rehydrated.

## Example usage

```javascript
import rehydrate from "react-from-markup";
import { rehydrator as siteHeaderRehydrator } from "./components/SiteHeader";
import { rehydrator as videoPlayerRehydrator } from "./components/VideoPlayer";

rehydrate(
  document.getElementById("root"),
  {
    SiteHeader: siteHeaderRehydrator,
    VideoPlayer: videoPlayerRehydrator
  },
  {
    extra: {
      user: {
        userName: document.body.dataset.userName,
        userId: document.body.dataset.userId
      }
    }
  }
)
```
