# Determining data-rehydratable-name from the markup

In the previous examples, you'll notice that the `data-rehydratable-name` needs to exist in three places: inside your component definition, in the markup that you integrate into your templates, and as a key in the list of rehydrators you pass to `react-from-markup`.

You could decouple your components from your implementation by having a `rehydratableName` prop, and reading the `data-rehydratable-name` prop in your rehydrator.

```javascript
import ShowMore from "./ShowMore";

// Modify <ShowMore /> so that its data-rehydratable-name prop looks like
//   data-rehydratable-name={this.props.rehydratableName}
// It might be useful to have a `defaultProps` value set, as well.

export default async (domNode) => {
  const props = {
    rehydratableName: domNode.getAttribute("data-rehydratable-name")
  };
  const children = await rehydrateChildren(domNode.querySelector(".ShowMore-children"));

  return <ShowMore {...props}>{children}</ShowMore>
};
```

By determining the rehydratable name in this way, only your templates and your call to `rehydrate` need to match. This could enable you to namespace your rehydratable names (for example, `mainSite-ShowMore`), without hard-coding the namespace into your components themselves.
