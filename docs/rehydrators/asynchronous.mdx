# Asynchronous rehydrators

> You may find the [`AsynchronousRehydrator` demo](/demo/AsynchronousRehydrator) useful to see how this works.

Rehydrators are expected to use `Promise`s. The main reason for this is to make use of the `import()` function, which is available in many module bundlers like `webpack`. It can help to keep your initial bundle size small, and only load component code as you need it.

There are two places where this may be appropriate: during rehydration, or during configuration.

## During rehydration

Your rehydrator can use `import()`, instead of declaring its `import`s at the top of the file. Using the `HelloUser` example, it could be modified to this:

```javascript
export default async (domNode, rehydrateChildren, { userName }) => {
  const HelloUser = (await import("./HelloUser")).default;

  return <HelloUser userName={userName} />;
};
```

`webpack` would be able to split `HelloUser.js` into a separate file, and only load it if a `HelloUser` rehydratable is found on the page.

## During configuration

It's not always possible to use `import()` inside the rehydrator. If you publish your components to NPM, for example, you might not want to include calls to `import()`, because it's not a function that's widely understood by browsers yet. It's an implementation-specific hook for module bundlers.

You can also save a few extra kilobytes on page load by moving your `import()` call further up the call stack, because then your rehydrators can be split off, too.

Regardless of your reasoning, it's entirely possible to use `import()` when you call `rehydrate()`. It would look something like this:

```javascript
import rehydrate from "react-from-markup";

rehydrate(
  document.getElementById("root"),
  {
    HelloUser: async (...args) => (await import("./components/HelloUser/rehydrator")).default(...args),
    ShowMore: async (...args) => (await import("./components/ShowMore/rehydrator")).default(...args)
  },
  {
    extra: {
      userName: Cookies.get("user_name")
    }
  }
);
```
