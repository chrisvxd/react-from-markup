# What's a rehydrator?

A rehydrator is a function, usually no more than a few lines, that maps a DOM element to a React element.

For technical documentation, see the [Rehydrator Interface API docs](/api/rehydrator).

For a more guided approach, you can step through this guide, starting with a [simple rehydrator](/rehydrators/simple).
