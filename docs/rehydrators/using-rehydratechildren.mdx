# Using rehydrateChildren

> A working version of this can be seen in the [`ShowMore` demo](/demo/ShowMore)

Let's take [our `ShowMore` component](/rehydrators/simple), and enhance it.

Instead of hiding or showing a `content` string, we want to hide or show some `children`, which can be arbitrary React elements. To accomplish this, we can use the `rehydrateChildren` function, which is always passed as the second argument to a rehydrator.

`rehydrateChildren` accepts a DOM node as its only argument, and - importantly - will return its _children_ as React elements. Passing in `<div><p>Hello, world!</p></div>`, for example, will only return `<p>Hello, world!</p>`.

`rehydrateChildren` returns a `Promise` - this is important to accomodate code splitting. You should always `await` it, or use `.then()`.

The rehydrator should look like this:

```javascript
import ShowMore from "./ShowMore";

export default async (domNode, rehydrateChildren) => {
  const children = await rehydrateChildren(
    domNode.querySelector(".ShowMore-children")
  );

  return <ShowMore>{children}</ShowMore>;
};
```

## `rehydrateChildren` and `React.Fragment`

If a component contains more than one child, then `rehydrateChildren` will return a `React.Fragment`. This may affect your components if you use `React.Children`, in order to iterate over child components from a parent component.

To overcome this, you have two options:

1. In your rehydrator function, you can check the type of the children you get back. If it's a `React.Fragment`, you can pass through its children. This isn't generally recommended, but it will work in a pinch.

  ```javascript
  (domNode, rehydrateChildren) => {
    const children = await rehydrateChildren(domNode.querySelector(".MyComponent-children"));

    if (children.type === React.Fragment) {
      return <MyComponent>{children.props.children}</MyComponent>;
    }

    return <MyComponent>{children}</MyComponent>
  }
  ```

2. Unwrap `React.Fragment` while you iterate over children. This has the added advantage of making your component work with fragments, rather than patching support into the rehydrator.

  ```javascript
  const getTitles = children => {
    const titles = [];

    React.Children.forEach(children, child => {
      if (child.type === React.Fragment) {
        // Recursively unwrap `React.Fragment`'s children, get their titles,
        // and add them to the return value.
        titles.push(...getTitles(child.props.children));
      } else if (child.type === MySubcomponent) {
        // For a specific component type, extract the title prop.
        titles.push(child.props.title);
      }
    });

    return titles;
  };
  ```

  You could extend this to `cloneElement`, as well.

  ```javascript
  const getTitles = children => {
    const titles = [];

    const mapCallback = child => {
      if (child.type === React.Fragment) {
        return (
          <React.Fragment>
            {React.Children.map(child.props.children, mapCallback)}
          </React.Fragment>
        );
      }

      if (child.type === MySubcomponent) {
        return React.cloneElement(
          child,
          { date: new Date() },
          child.props.children
        );
      }

      return child;
    };

    return React.Children.map(children, mapCallback);
  };
  ```
