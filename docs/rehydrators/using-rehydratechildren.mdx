# Using rehydrateChildren

> A working version of this can be seen in the [`ShowMore` demo](/demo/ShowMore)

Let's take [our `ShowMore` component](/rehydrators/simple), and enhance it.

Instead of hiding or showing a `content` string, we want to hide or show some `children`, which can be arbitrary React elements. To accomplish this, we can use the `rehydrateChildren` function, which is always passed as the second argument to a rehydrator.

`rehydrateChildren` accepts a DOM node as its only argument, and - importantly - will return its _children_ as React elements. Passing in `<div><p>Hello, world!</p></div>`, for example, will only return `<p>Hello, world!</p>`.

`rehydrateChildren` returns a `Promise` - this is important to accomodate code splitting. You should always `await` it, or use `.then()`.

The rehydrator should look like this:

```javascript
import ShowMore from "./ShowMore";

export default async (domNode, rehydrateChildren) => {
  const children = await rehydrateChildren(domNode.querySelector(".ShowMore-children"));

  return <ShowMore>{children}</ShowMore>;
}
```
