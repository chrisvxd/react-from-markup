# Static rehydration demo

Demonstrates rehydrating some static markup into static React elements.

<Playground>
  <MarkupContainer rehydrators={{}}>
    <p>I'll be rehydrated, but I won't be interactive.</p>
    <p>react-from-markup only really gets useful when interactive rehydrators get involved.</p>
  </MarkupContainer>
</Playground>
