# Asynchronous Rehydrators

This demo is meant to demonstrate how asynchronous rehydration works.

It also demonstrates how a rehydrator can _change_ an element - before rehydration, the `AsynchronousRehydrator` element shows how long it will take to rehydrate, but after rehydration, it simply tells you that it's compelted rehydration.

The `separateContainers` prop on `MarkupContainer` can be set to false, to demonstrate the benefits of having multiple containers on your page. If each `AsynchronousRehydrator` is wrapped in a single container, rehydration will only complete when _all_ rehydrators have finished running, but when they're each in a separate container, they render independently.

While you wouldn't ever write a rehydrator using an intentional delay in a real site, it's a useful demo of how `import()` _could_ work in your bundles with `react-from-markup`.

<Playground>
  <MarkupContainer rehydrators={{AsynchronousRehydrator: rehydrator}} options={{}} separateContainers={true}>
    <AsynchronousRehydrator delay={5000} />
    <AsynchronousRehydrator delay={100} />
    <AsynchronousRehydrator delay={10000} />
    <AsynchronousRehydrator delay={2500} />
    <AsynchronousRehydrator delay={500} />
    <AsynchronousRehydrator delay={7500} />
  </MarkupContainer>
