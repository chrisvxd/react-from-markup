# How these demos work

Each demo is wrapped in a `MarkupContainer`. This is a special component that was written for these docs. It runs `react-from-markup` any time its children change.

`MarkupContainer` accepts two props, `rehydrators` and `options`, which map to the [`rehydrators` and `options` parameters on `rehydrate`](/api/rehydrate).

Each demo has some sample code, which can be edited in place to see its effects.
