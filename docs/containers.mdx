# Markup containers

`react-from-markup` will only rehydrate elements inside a _markup container_.

A markup container is simply a DOM element that has a `data-react-from-markup-container` attribute on it.

You can have as many markup containers on your page as you like.


## Declaring a container

In your markup, simply wrap any elements that you wish to rehydrate in a container:

```html
<div data-react-from-markup-container>
  <p>When the page loads, I'll be turned into a static React node.</p>
</div>
```
