# Installation

Install `react-from-markup`:

```shell
yarn add react react-dom react-from-markup
```

Then, when your page loads, use it to rehydrate your page.

```javascript
import rehydrate from "react-from-markup";

rehydrate(document.getElementById("root"), {});
```

This will rehydrate any [markup containers](/containers) on your page - but in order to do anything useful, you'll want to specify some [rehydrators](/rehydrators).
